# About Pilleriappi
Pilleriappi is our first Android application developed using Java. The primary goal of the app is to assist individuals with medication needs by serving as a reminder for them to take their prescribed medicines. Users can easily add their medications to the application and specify the date and time for each dosage. While the application may not be flawless, it served as a valuable learning experience as our team's first foray into app development.
